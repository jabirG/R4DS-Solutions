## 6.2.1 Exercises

1.Using prose, describe how the variables and observations are organised in each of the sample tables

2.  

Sketch out the process you'd use to calculate the `rate` for `table2` and `table4a` + `table4b`. You will need to perform four operations:

a.  Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.

b.  Extract the matching population per country per year.

c.  Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.

d.  Store back in the appropriate place.

    ```{r}

    table2 |>
      pivot_wider(
        names_from = type,
        values_from = count
      ) |> mutate(rate = cases/population * 10000)
    ```

```{r}

table4a |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -country,
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "n"
  )

```
